# Assertion CheatSheet for FPGA Developers

## Systemverilog Concurrent assertion
### Boolean Expression
1. Logical operators: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT)
2. Equality operators: == (equal), != (not equal)
3. Relational operators: < (less than), <= (less than or equal), > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal)
4. Bitwise operators: & (bitwise AND), | (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise XOR)
5. Reduction operators: & (AND reduction), | (OR reduction), ^ (XOR reduction)
```systemverilog
c_assert: assert property(@(posedge clk) not(a && b)); //If there is a posedge in the clk, the assertion will be failed if a and b are high at the same times.
```

### Sequence

```systemverilog
sequence <name_of_sequence>;
  â€¦â€¦
endsequence
```

Sequences with Timing Relationship
```systemverilog
// "a" should be high at every clock's positive edge, "b" should be high two cycles later; otherwise, the sequence fails.
sequence seq;
@(posedge clk) a ##2 b;
endsequence
```

Implication operator
```systemverilog
// The |-> symbol represents the overlapped implication operator.Consequent evaluation starts immediately if the antecedent is true.It's akin to an if-then structure.
property p;
@(posedge clk) a|->b;
endproperty

//The |=> symbol denotes the non-overlapped implication operator.Consequent evaluation begins in the next clock cycle if the antecedent holds true.If "a" is high at a positive clock edge, "b" should be high at the subsequent clock edge.
property p;
@(posedge clk) a |=> b;
endproperty

//Implication with a fixed delay on the consequent:The property verifies that if "a" is high on a specific positive clock edge, then "b" should be high after a delay of n clock cycles.
property p;
@(posedge clk) a |-> ##n b;
endproperty

//Timing Window: The property "p" asserts that if "a" rises on a positive clock edge, then within n to m clock cycles, "b" should also rise. (n>=0, m>1, m>n)
//m upper limit can be defined with a "$" sign, indicating no upper bound, termed the "eventuality" operator. The checker continues matching until the end of the simulation.
property p;
@(posedge clk) a |-> ##[n:m] b;
endproperty

//If a sequence of events occurs repeatedly for n times, it's represented as [*n].(n > 0, n < $)
//if req1 is true, req2 must be true for n consecutive clock cycles after 1 clock cycle.
sequence seq;
@(posedge clk) req1 ##1 req2[*n];
endsequence

//The repetition operator can be used in a range using [*m:n].
//if req1 is true, then after 1 clock cycle, req2 must be true for a minimum of m and a maximum of n consecutive clock cycles.
sequence seq;
@(posedge clk) req1 ##1 req2[*m:n];
endsequence

//Non Consecutive repetitive operator:If sequence event repetition needs to be detected for n non-consecutive clock cycles, [=n] can be used
sequence seq;
@(posedge clk) req1 ## req2[=n];
endsequence

//The non-consecutive repetitive operator with a range:Non-consecutive repetition can be specified within a range as [=m:n]
sequence seq;
@(posedge clk) req1 ##1 req2[=n:m];
endsequence
```

#### reusability
```systemverilog
Sequence and_seq(a,b);
a  && b;
endsequence

sequence sig_34
and_seq(sig_3,sig_4);
endsequence
```
